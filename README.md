# MystanCodeProjects

These projects are assignments from StanCode SC001 & SC101, 11 assignments in total. Each assignment is allocated to a separate file, with the number indicating the sequence, for example, '0_assignmentname', '1_assignmentname', and so on.

Within each assignment, you will find several Python files. To run the assignments smoothly, I recommend downloading the entire assignment file, as all the necessary components are gathered within the same file.
